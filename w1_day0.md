## Notes

1. modifier: the "_;" in modifier will auto copy the next part of code into it. And it will do recursive copy one by one, from leftmost to rightmost.
2. Solidity address length: 20 bytes, 160 bits, 40 hex char
3. contract creation bytecode contains both 1)initialization code and 2) the contract actual runtime code, concatenated in sequential order.
