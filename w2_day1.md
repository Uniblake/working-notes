5. capital efficiency: capital efficiency is the ratio of how much a company is spending on growing revenue and how much they're getting in return. For example, if a company is earning one dollar for every dollar spent on growth, it has a 1:1 ratio of capital efficiency. You can also call it the return on capital employed, or ROCE.
6. Three order types:
    1. Market Order: when you want to process your order as quickly as possible, with slippage.
    2. Limit Order: buy or sell at a specific price or better.

    to eliminate slippage, traders use limit order but not market order.
